# Preemptively Answered Questions (PAQ)

Answering questions before they're asked now, and answering the frequently asked ones later.

## Why is this here?

This doc serves as an answer to the FAQ, which seems to be inaccurately used at times.

The term, "FAQ", meaning "Frequently Asked Questions" implies that there were questions that were asked frequently in the first place.

That would make sense for already-existing projects that have received the same questions frequently.

The FAQ, ideally, is there to cover these questions to avoid redundancy.

I'd be hard-pressed to believe a new project with an FAQ section has many asked questions at all.

Of course, this is merely an assumption; how anyone conducts their projects is up to them.

With that said, if the intention was to provide answers ahead of time, then the PAQ is better suited for this task.

All that needs to be done is to come up with questions that might be asked, and answer them.

It sounds really simple, but it's also more accurate to the intention now.
